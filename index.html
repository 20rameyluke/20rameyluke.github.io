			<p>1. Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.</a></p>
			<p>2. Github was founded by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, Scott Chacon, and P. J. Hyett.<p>
			<p>3. A hub is a center around which activity is focused.<p>
			<p>4. A repository lets you store files. It allows you to see changes and has a structure like a folder.<p>
			<p>5. Github seems really useful and I have been on it before. I never understood exactly what it was for, but if I ever make a large program with others, I would probably use Github as a means to keep everything sorted.<p>
